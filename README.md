# CLIPS2

Neural Network Simulations based on Contrastive Learning in Infant's Pattern Structures (CLIPS).  

Simple Recurrent Networks simulating two similar/dissimilar objects with different/matching labels. 




##  Details

Network_1 == highlighting objects, blank slides in-between (16 timesteps)

Network_2 == No highlighting objects, just simple presentations (8 timesteps)
